- Place the subject in the frame: rule-of-thirds position, foreground vs midground, negative space
- Note interactions: leaning on, holding, reaching toward, or occluding other elements

- Visible neck, shoulders, and neckline; ear/jewelry if present

- Leading lines, symmetry, framing devices (doorways, windows, arches)

- Tie props to pose: how clothing drapes or moves with the body
